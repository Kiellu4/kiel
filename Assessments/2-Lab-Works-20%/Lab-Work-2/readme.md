## A. Lab Objectives

1. Identify and exploit cryptographic weaknesses in database authentication and password storage.  
2. Perform offline hash cracking after discovering password hashes in a vulnerable database.  
3. Investigate real-world cryptographic failures and propose secure solutions.  
4. Document findings clearly in GitHub (Markdown) and present a short demo/debrief.

## B. Lab Tasks

### 1. Service Enumeration and Initial Access

- Identify the database service running on the target.  
- Attempt to connect to the database service from Kali.  
- Observe any errors during the connection attempt and investigate.  

> üí° **Hint:** The database service on the target is not properly secured and has known cryptographic flaws.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Analyze Problems Encountered

- Were there any issues connecting to the database?  
- How did you resolve the connection error?  
- Document the exact command used to connect, and how you verified access.

### 2. Enumeration of Users and Authentication Weakness

- After gaining access, enumerate the database users.  
- Determine which users have cryptographic authentication flaws.  

> üí° **Hint:** Pay close attention to the password column in the user table.

#### Task

- Identify any users with no passwords or weak access control.  
- Attempt to authenticate using these accounts from Kali.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Question

- Is accessing a database with no password a cryptographic failure?  
- Explain how this violates secure cryptographic authentication principles.

### 3. Password Hash Discovery and Hash Identification

- Investigate available databases and identify any tables containing password hashes.  
- Extract and list the hashes found.  

> üí° **Hint:** One database contains user credentials stored as hashes.

- Use hash identification tools (`hashid`, `hash-identifier`) to identify the hashing algorithm used.  
- Explain how you determined the type of hash.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Question

- What cryptographic weaknesses exist in this hashing method?

---

### 4. Offline Hash Cracking

- Attempt to crack the extracted hashes using tools of your choice (e.g., `hashcat`, `john`).  
- Document the commands used, and which hashes were cracked.  
- Analyze the entropy and strength of cracked passwords.

---

### 5. Cryptographic Analysis and Mitigation

- Summarize the cryptographic issues identified:
  - Authentication flaws  
  - Weak password hashing  
  - Transmission of data (if applicable)  
- Propose secure alternatives:
  - Stronger hashing algorithms (e.g., `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, `Argon2`)  
  - Encrypted communication (e.g., SSL/TLS)  
- **Optional:** Use Wireshark to check if any password/hash data is transmitted unencrypted.

## C. Report Instructions

- Write a Markdown report documenting your process:
  - Problem analysis  
  - Tools used  
  - Commands, screenshots  
  - Cryptographic weakness explanation  
  - Mitigation proposals  
- Push the report to a **GitHub Public Repository**.  
- Include answers to reflection questions throughout the lab.

---

## D. Demo/Debrief (5‚Äì15 mins)

- Brief demo of your hash cracking or database access.  
- Present your analysis of cryptographic weaknesses and proposed mitigations.
